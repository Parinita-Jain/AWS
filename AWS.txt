AWS --

IAM- identity Access mgmt
Identity Authentication and access mgmt. It is a web service
that securely helps control access to AWS resources.
U use IAM to control who is authorized (signed in)
and authorized (has pernission) to use resources.

1. sign-up for aws--
verify
root user pwd-- confirm pwd
personal

on successful registration u get aws mgmt console.

sign in- root user

Now a company shares I AM account with employees
and not root user account. IAM is a framework or
policies.

root user-- create many user passwords called as I AM user,
give permissions to different user,

Command line (CIL)and GUI, MFA

IAM user and ploicies--
root user can create 5000 IAM user .
can add upto 10 users in 1 login
limited to 300 groups per AWS account.
to every user, 1000 IAM roles can be given under AWS account.
Default limits to managed policies attached 
to an IAM role and IAM user is 10.
1 IAM user can be a member of 10 groups max. We can increase it.
We can assign 2 access keys(max) to an IAM user.

Compute services-- ec2, lightsail,elastic beanstalk,lambda

ec2 instance--
A server is a computer connected to a network of other workstations called 'clients'. Client computers request information from the server over the network. Servers tend to have more storage, memory and processing power than a normal workstation.
A virtual server in the AWS Cloud is called as an Instance. With Amazon EC2, you can set up and configure the operating system and applications that run on your instance.

You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions you define.

You can use the fleet management features of EC2 Auto Scaling to maintain the health and availability of your fleet.

Dynamic scaling responds to changing demand and predictive scaling automatically schedules the right number of EC2 instances based on predicted demand.

Groups
Groups are the logical groups which contain the collection of EC2 instances with similar characteristics for scaling and management purpose.

Launch Configuration
The launch configuration is a template used by auto scaling group to launch EC2 instances. You can specify the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), instances type, key pair, and security groups etc.. while creating the launch configuration. You can also modify the launch configuration after creation. Launch configuration can be used for multiple auto scaling groups.

Scale based on demand:- This is the most advanced scaling model, resources scales by using a scaling policy. Based on specific parameters you can scale in or scale out your resources. You can create a policy by defining the parameter such as CPU utilization, Memory, Network In and Out etc. For Example, you can dynamically scale your EC2 instances which exceeds the CPU utilization beyond 70%. If CPU utilization crosses this threshold value, the auto scaling launches new instances using the launch configuration. You should specify two scaling policies, one for scaling In (terminating instances) and one for scaling out (launching instances).

In summary, AWS Lambda simplifies the process of deploying and running code, allowing you to focus on building your applications without the need to manage servers. It's a powerful tool for modern, scalable, and cost-effective cloud computing.

Amazon elastic block storage--
EBS is like a disk drive of an instance 
either SSd or HDD. They are attached to an EC2 instance and physically reside in the same availability zone as the EC2 instance.

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances.
EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices.
You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances.
EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the instance.
You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.
 

 
With Amazon EBS, you pay only for what you use.

Snapshots
Snapshots are just like the backups that you activate in your phone, laptop or any devices to make sure that even if you loose your data's by any chance you can retrieve it if you already have a backup of it.
The same process can be done with your Block storage too.

Amazon EBS provides the ability to create snapshots (backups) of any EBS volume and write a copy of the data in the volume to Amazon S3, where it is stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones.


Amazon elastic file system--

Lets discuss about NFS first and then move on to EFS..


Network File System ( NFS ) is nothing is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984, allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.
AWS EFS supports NFS 4.0 and 4.1, but an important caveat is that NFS on Amazon only works with Linux instances (Amazon provides shared storage for Windows using a different service, Amazon FSx)



Amazon Elastic File System is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services designed to provide scalable, elastic, concurrent with some restrictions, and encrypted file storage for use with both AWS cloud services and on-premises resources.

Amazon EFS provides scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2. You can use an EFS file system as a common data source for workloads and applications running on multiple instances.

What is AWS EFS used for?
Amazon EFS provides a simple, serverless, set-and-forget elastic file system. With Amazon EFS, you can create a file system, mount the file system on an Amazon EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and from your file system.

Amazon simple storage service--

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Let's break down the key concepts and features:



Key Concepts:

Object Storage:



Amazon S3 is an object storage service, which means it stores data as objects. Each object consists of data, a key (unique within a bucket), and metadata.

Buckets:



In Amazon S3, data is stored in containers called "buckets." A bucket is like a top-level folder for organizing objects. Each bucket has a globally unique name within AWS.

Objects:



Objects are the basic unit of storage in Amazon S3. They can be anything from a simple text file to a complex set of data. Objects can range in size from a few bytes to terabytes.

Keys:



The key is a unique identifier for an object within a bucket. The combination of the bucket name and the object key forms a unique URL for each object stored in Amazon S3.

Regions:



Amazon S3 is available in different geographical regions. When you create a bucket, you choose the region where the bucket will be stored. This allows you to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements.

Features and Use Cases:

Durability and Availability:



Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability, meaning your data is highly resilient to hardware failures. It also provides 99.99% availability.

Scalability:



S3 automatically scales to handle growing amounts of data. You don't need to worry about capacity planning or performance optimization.

Security:



S3 provides multiple layers of security. You can control access to your buckets and objects using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies. It also integrates with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for fine-grained access control.

Versioning:



Amazon S3 supports versioning, allowing you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. This is useful for data recovery and protection against accidental deletions.

Lifecycle Policies:



You can define lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects to different storage classes or delete them when they are no longer needed.

Static Website Hosting:



S3 can be used to host static websites, making it a cost-effective solution for hosting static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Data Transfer Acceleration:



Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files to and from Amazon S3. It utilizes the Amazon CloudFront global content delivery network (CDN) to accelerate transfers.

How It Works:

Create a Bucket:



You start by creating a bucket in a specific AWS region. This is like creating a top-level folder to store your objects.

Upload Objects:



You upload your objects (files, documents, images, etc.) into the buckets. Each object is assigned a unique key.

Access Control:



You can control who has access to your buckets and objects by configuring bucket policies, IAM roles, and Access Control Lists (ACLs).

Retrieve and Use:



Once your data is in Amazon S3, you can retrieve it programmatically or through the AWS Management Console. It can be used for various purposes, such as hosting static websites, storing backups, or serving as a data lake.

Use Cases:

Backup and Restore:



Businesses use S3 to store backup copies of their critical data for disaster recovery.

Data Archiving:



S3 provides a cost-effective solution for archiving infrequently accessed data.

Content Distribution:



It can be used in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront to distribute content globally with low-latency and high transfer speeds.

Big Data Analytics:



Amazon S3 is often used as a data lake for big data analytics. Data can be ingested and analyzed directly from S3.

Static Website Hosting:



S3 is a popular choice for hosting static websites due to its scalability and cost-effectiveness.

In summary, Amazon S3 is a highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. It is a foundational service in the AWS ecosystem and is widely used for various storage needs.

Compute services--
ELB-- for distributed computing architecture.
Their role is to distribute incoming network traffic
among cluster of distributed servers so that the workdone by single
computer gets distributed among multiple computers
.
3 types of load balancers are--
1.classic lb-- first-ever load balancer introduced by AWS in the year 2009-- http,https,tcp
How Classic Load Balancers work
1.  Your client makes a request to your application.
2.  The listeners in your load balancer receive requests for the matching protocol and port.
3.  Each listener forwards requests to registered instances which are considered healthy according to the health checks you configure. TCP listeners apply round-robin routing while HTTP/HTTPS listeners apply the least outstanding requests algorithm. You can add or remove instances from your load balancer as needed without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your application.
Note: Classic load balancers cannot route to target groups.



2.application lb-- http,https,websocket

The second type of load balancer that we are going to cover is Application Load Balancer.

Application Load Balancer (v2) is the new generation load balancer that was introduced in 2016.

ALB supports HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket protocol. 



AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) operates at Layer 7 of the OSI model. At Layer 7, the ELB can inspect application-level content, not just IP and port. This lets it route based on more complex rules than with the Classic Load Balancer.

 

In another example, an ELB at a given IP will receive a request from the client on port 443 (HTTPS). The Application Load Balancer will process the request, not only by receiving port but also by looking at the destination URL.

 

Multiple services can share a single load balancer using path-based routing. In the example given here, the client could request any of the following URLs:

 

Application Load Balancer will be aware of each of these URLs based on patterns set up when configuring the load balancer and can route to different clusters of servers depending on application need. Rules can also be added at a later time as you add new functionality to your stack.

The Application Load Balancer also integrates with EC2 Container Service (ECS) using Service Load Balancing. 
This allows for dynamic mapping of services to ports as specified in the ECS task definition. 
Multiple containers can be targeted on the same EC2 instance, each running different services on different ports. 
The ECS task scheduler will automatically add these tasks to the ALB.


3.network lb-- tcp,tls(secure tcp) and udp
- u can set up internal(private) or external(public) elbs
NLB supports TCP, TLS & UDP.

A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule.

It attempts to open a TCP connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.

--- Amazon database--

Amazon Aurora is a fully managed relational database engine provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, offering high performance, scalability, and reliability.

7. Security: Aurora provides security features such as encryption at rest and in transit. It supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation, and you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control.



8. Serverless Aurora (Aurora Serverless): Aurora Serverless is a mode of Aurora that automatically adjusts its capacity based on actual usage. This can be particularly beneficial for applications with unpredictable workloads, as it eliminates the need for manual capacity planning.



How It Works:



1. Database Instances: An Aurora database consists of one primary instance and up to 15 read replicas. The primary instance handles write operations, and read replicas handle read operations.



2. Storage: Aurora uses a distributed and fault-tolerant storage system that automatically divides your database volume into 10GB segments spread across many disks. Each 10GB chunk of your database volume is replicated six ways, across three Availability Zones.



3. Read Replicas: Aurora allows you to create up to 15 read replicas, which can be used to offload read traffic and improve performance. Read replicas are automatically kept up to date with the primary instance.



4. Automatic Failover: In the event of a failure, Aurora can automatically and transparently failover to a read replica, minimizing downtime.



5. Global Databases: You can create a global database that spans multiple AWS regions. This allows you to have low-latency access to your data globally.



Use Cases:



1. High-Performance Applications: Aurora is well-suited for applications with high-performance requirements, such as e-commerce platforms, gaming applications, and financial services.



2. Mission-Critical Workloads: Due to its high availability, durability, and automatic failover capabilities, Aurora is suitable for mission-critical workloads that require minimal downtime.



3. Global Applications: Global Databases in Aurora make it a good choice for applications that need low-latency access to data from multiple geographic regions.



4. Scalable Workloads: Aurora's automatic scaling features make it suitable for workloads with varying demand, allowing the database to scale up or down based on usage.

--VPC and Networking--

A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a fundamental component of cloud computing infrastructure, particularly within platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables users to create isolated and logically defined sections within the cloud where they can deploy and run their resources. Here are the key aspects of Virtual Private Cloud explained:



1. Isolation and Segmentation:

   - A VPC provides a logically isolated section of the cloud where you can launch AWS resources. It acts as a private network in the cloud, allowing you to create a segmented environment for your applications and services.



2. Custom Networking:

   - With a VPC, you have control over your network configuration. You can define your own IP address range, create subnets, configure route tables, and set up network gateways. This flexibility allows you to design a network that meets the specific requirements of your applications.



3. Subnetting:

   - A VPC can be divided into multiple subnets. Subnets are segments of the VPC's IP address range where you can place resources. This allows you to organize and manage your resources based on different security and operational requirements.



4. Internet Connectivity:

   - By default, instances in a VPC are not accessible from the internet. However, you can configure internet access by attaching an Internet Gateway to your VPC. This allows resources within the VPC to communicate with the internet and vice versa.



5. Private Networking:

   - In addition to internet connectivity, you can create private subnets within a VPC that do not have direct access to the internet. This is useful for hosting sensitive workloads that should not be exposed to the public internet.



6. Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):

   - VPCs use security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance and subnet levels. Security groups are stateful, and NACLs are stateless, providing different layers of security control.



7. Virtual Private Network (VPN) and Direct Connect:

   - VPCs support secure connectivity to on-premises data centers through VPN connections or AWS Direct Connect. This allows you to extend your on-premises network to the cloud securely.



8. Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) and Auto Scaling:

   - VPC integrates with Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) and Auto Scaling, enabling the automatic distribution of incoming application traffic across multiple instances and the ability to scale resources based on demand.



9. Peering and Transit Gateways:

   - VPC peering allows you to connect VPCs together and route traffic between them privately. Transit Gateway is a centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, simplifying network architecture.



10. Resource Deployment:

    - Within a VPC, you can deploy various AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 storage, and more. The VPC acts as the networking foundation that ties these resources together.



In summary, a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a foundational element in cloud computing that provides users with the ability to create a private, isolated, and customizable network in the cloud. It offers control over networking, security, and connectivity, allowing for the deployment of diverse applications and services in a secure and scalable manner.

Security Groups:

A Security Group acts as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. It is associated with instances, and you can specify rules that control the traffic to and from these instances. Here are key points about Security Groups:



1. Stateful Filtering:

   - Security Groups are stateful, meaning if you allow inbound traffic from a specific IP, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed. This simplifies rule configuration.



2. Inbound and Outbound Rules:

   - You can define inbound rules to control incoming traffic and outbound rules to control outgoing traffic. Rules are based on protocols, ports, and IP ranges.



3. Allow Rules Only:

   - Security Groups only allow traffic; there are no explicit "deny" rules. If a rule doesn't explicitly permit the traffic, it is implicitly denied.



4. Instance Level:

   - Security Groups are associated with instances, and each instance can have multiple security groups. When an instance is launched, you can specify the security groups it belongs to.



5. Stateful Connection Tracking:

   - The stateful nature of Security Groups means that once a connection is established, the response traffic is automatically allowed, facilitating communication between instances.



6. Implicit Outbound Rules:

   - Outbound traffic is allowed by default. You don't need to specify outbound rules unless you want to restrict certain types of outbound traffic.



7. Changes Take Effect Immediately:

   - Changes to Security Group rules take effect immediately, reducing the risk of misconfigurations.



Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):

Network Access Control Lists are an additional layer of security for your VPC. While Security Groups operate at the instance level, NACLs operate at the subnet level. Here are key points about NACLs:



1. Stateless Filtering:

   - NACLs are stateless, meaning that if you allow inbound traffic, you must also explicitly allow the corresponding outbound traffic. Each rule applies independently.



2. Inbound and Outbound Rules:

   - Similar to Security Groups, NACLs have inbound and outbound rules. Rules are based on protocols, ports, and IP ranges.



3. Explicit Allow and Deny Rules:

   - NACLs support both explicit "allow" and "deny" rules, giving you more control over traffic. Unlike Security Groups, which allow by default, NACLs deny all traffic by default.



4. Ordered Rule Set:

   - Rules in NACLs are evaluated based on their order. The rules are processed in numerical order, starting with the lowest rule number. This allows for precise control over the flow of traffic.



5. Subnet Level:

   - NACLs are associated with subnets, and each subnet in a VPC must be associated with a NACL. A subnet can be associated with only one NACL at a time.



6. Changes Take Effect Immediately:

   - Similar to Security Groups, changes to NACL rules take effect immediately.



7. Logging:

   - NACLs offer the capability to log information about the traffic that matches a rule. This is useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.



In summary, Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists are both essential components of AWS networking and security. Security Groups operate at the instance level and are stateful, while NACLs operate at the subnet level and are stateless. Both are used to control inbound and outbound traffic but offer different features and capabilities. Understanding how to use these effectively is crucial for designing a secure and well-performing AWS environment.


--Security--

Encryption with KMS--


Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format that can only be read by authorized users or systems. AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. Here's an explanation of encryption with KMS:



1. Key Generation:

   - KMS allows you to generate cryptographic keys, referred to as Customer Master Keys (CMKs), that are used to encrypt and decrypt your data. CMKs can be either symmetric or asymmetric, depending on your use case.



2. Key Storage and Management:

   - KMS securely stores and manages the keys, relieving you of the responsibility of key management. AWS handles the complexities of key rotation, versioning, and access control.



3. Data Encryption:

   - Once you have a CMK, you can use it to encrypt your sensitive data. For symmetric keys, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Other services overview--

In the world of AWS, imagine containers as portable, self-sufficient boxes containing your applications and their dependencies. AWS ECS takes this concept further by employing Docker containers, ensuring uniformity across various environments. These containers are the building blocks for deploying applications consistently.



When we talk about ECS, we start with the concept of a "Task Definition." This is akin to a recipe for your application, detailing which containers to use, their configurations, and how they interact. Think of it as the blueprint guiding ECS on how to bring your application to life.



Once defined, these tasks become live instances of your application. They are the tangible entities, executing the instructions laid out in the task definition. A task can involve multiple containers, each contributing to the overall functionality, and they share the same set of resources.



Services in ECS play the role of caretakers for your tasks. They ensure that a specific number of tasks are always operational, automatically replacing any failed ones to maintain uninterrupted service. This orchestration of tasks happens within a "Cluster," which is a grouping of container instances.



These container instances are essentially the hosts for your tasks. Whether they are EC2 instances or Fargate instances, each comes with an ECS agent. This agent acts as a coordinator, communicating with ECS, launching and stopping tasks as necessary.



Speaking of coordination, ECS seamlessly integrates with other AWS services. From databases (RDS) to storage (S3) and identity management (IAM) to monitoring (CloudWatch), ECS collaborates with these services to provide a holistic environment for your containerized applications.



For managing incoming traffic and ensuring scalability, ECS integrates with the Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). This distributes traffic evenly across containers within a service, preventing overload on a single instance.



ECS offers flexibility in task scheduling. Whether you decide manually where your tasks should run or let ECS handle it automatically, the system aims to balance loads and resources efficiently. Additionally, task placement strategies help determine how tasks are distributed across instances.



One notable feature is the support for both managed and unmanaged launch types. With Fargate, AWS takes care of the underlying infrastructure, while with EC2 instances, you gain more control over the environment.



In summary, ECS simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, providing a structured approach to ensure they are where they need to be, doing what they're meant to do. From task recipes to the orchestrating agents and the hosting clusters, ECS facilitates a seamless and scalable containerized application environment.

Let's dive into Amazon EKS, a powerful service for managing and orchestrating containerized applications using Kubernetes. In this class, we'll break down the key components and concepts.



Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform. EKS takes the robustness of Kubernetes and integrates it seamlessly into the AWS ecosystem.



At the core of EKS are "Clusters." These clusters act as the control plane for orchestrating containerized applications. They manage the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. Just like ECS, EKS clusters can scale to meet the needs of your applications.



Within these clusters, we have "Nodes." Nodes are the underlying EC2 instances or, with the introduction of AWS Fargate, serverless compute engine instances. Nodes are responsible for running the actual containers.



A critical concept in EKS is the "Pod." A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, representing a single instance of a running process in a cluster. Pods can contain one or more containers, tightly coupled and sharing the same network namespace.



Now, let's talk about "Services." In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. EKS integrates with Elastic Load Balancers to expose these services to the internet, ensuring high availability and load balancing.



"Deployments" in EKS allow you to declaratively manage the desired state of your application. You define how many replicas of a Pod should run, and Kubernetes ensures that the actual state matches the desired state.



For application configuration, Kubernetes introduces "ConfigMaps" and "Secrets." ConfigMaps store non-sensitive data in key-value pairs, while Secrets are used for confidential information like passwords or API keys.



EKS also provides seamless integration with other AWS services. Whether it's accessing databases, storage, or utilizing AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), EKS allows for a cohesive ecosystem.



One significant advantage of EKS is its compatibility with Kubernetes tooling. This means you can leverage existing Kubernetes skills, configurations, and applications seamlessly.



As we explore EKS, remember that it is a managed Kubernetes service. AWS takes care of the undifferentiated heavy lifting, such as patching, updates, and maintaining the control plane, allowing you to focus more on building and running your applications.



In conclusion, Amazon EKS combines the power of Kubernetes with the ease of use and integration of AWS. It provides a robust and scalable platform for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications, making it a valuable tool in the world of cloud-native computing.

Let's delve into Amazon CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the distribution of your web content. In this class, we'll explore its key components and how it optimizes the delivery of your resources to end-users.



At the heart of CloudFront is the concept of a "Distribution." A Distribution represents the collection of servers (edge locations) around the world that cache and deliver your content. These edge locations are strategically positioned to reduce latency and provide efficient content delivery.



When you set up a CloudFront Distribution, you designate the origin of your content. This can be an Amazon S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, an Elastic Load Balancer, or even a non-AWS origin server. CloudFront pulls the content from this origin and caches it at edge locations.



The term "Edge Locations" is crucial in understanding CloudFront's efficiency. These are data centers located in different geographic locations. When a user requests content, CloudFront delivers it from the nearest edge location, reducing latency and accelerating content delivery.



Cache behavior plays a significant role in determining how CloudFront interacts with the origin and serves content. You can set rules to specify when CloudFront should forward requests to the origin and when it should use the cached content from the edge location.



To secure your content and ensure that it is delivered over HTTPS, CloudFront provides easy integration with Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage SSL/TLS certificates.



CloudFront also supports "Distributions Types." Web Distributions are optimized for delivering dynamic and static web content, while RTMP Distributions are designed for streaming media files using the Adobe Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).



Logging and monitoring are crucial aspects of managing content delivery. CloudFront integrates with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging to provide insights into the performance and behavior of your distribution.



One powerful feature of CloudFront is its ability to integrate with other AWS services seamlessly. Whether you're using it with S3 for scalable object storage, EC2 for compute resources, or AWS WAF for web application firewall protection, CloudFront enhances the overall performance and security of your applications.



In summary, Amazon CloudFront is a versatile CDN service that optimizes the delivery of web content by leveraging a global network of edge locations. With features such as easy integration, cache behavior customization, and robust security options, CloudFront becomes a valuable tool for enhancing the speed, reliability, and security of your web applications.
